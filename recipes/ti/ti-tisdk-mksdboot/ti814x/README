The purpose of this readme is to describe on how to create SD card for DM814x EVM.

1. Download EVSDK from ....

2. Install the EVSDK on supported Linux host machine.
  host # ./ezsdk_dm814x-evm_5_00_00_00_setuplinux.bin

3. Power OFF the EVM.

4. Plug a 4GB SD card on Linux host machine.

5. Run dmesg command to check the device node. Triple check this to ensure you 
   do not damage your HDD contents! E.g.

  host # dmesg
    [14365.272631] sd 6:0:0:1: [sdc] 3862528 512-byte logical blocks: (1.97 GB/1.84 GiB)
    [14365.310602] sd 6:0:0:1: [sdc] Assuming drive cache: write through
    [14365.325542] sd 6:0:0:1: [sdc] Assuming drive cache: write through
    [14365.325571]  sdc: sdc1 sdc2

  * In this example, SD card is detected on /dev/sdc.

6. Run mksdboot script on host machine to create SD card.

   host # sudo ./mksdboot.sh --device /dev/sdc --sdk <sdk_installation_location>
     <installation bin file names>

   e.g
    sudo ./mksdboot --device /dev/sdc --sdk /home/user/ti-ezsdk_dm814x-evm_5_00 
    /downloads/ezsdk_dm814x-evm_5_00_00_00_setuplinux.bin

7. On completion, plug the SD card on EVM and Power cycle the board.

8. Note! If your flash already has a u-boot environment stored, this will get
   picked up even while booting from SD-card. If this is the case, halt the
   u-boot auto boot process and enter the following command:

   TI814x_EVM # nand erase 0x260000 0
