# Make sure 3D submenu has been installed and app images has been installed

# TODO: in the future we may want to consider putting this into the libgles
#       recipe directly.  Requires broad acceptance of matrix v2 though due
#       to the matrix-gui-submenus-3d dependency.  So if matrix v2 moves
#       into the same layer as libgles this may be acceptable, or perhaps
#       we can use an RRECOMMENDS instead.
