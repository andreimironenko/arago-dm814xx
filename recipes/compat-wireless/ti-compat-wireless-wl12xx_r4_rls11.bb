# This is a TI specific version of the compat-wireless recipe using a 
# compat-wireless package created from the TI Systems Tested mac80211 releases.
#
# This approach has been taken to simplify the packaging of a compat-wireless 
# release for WL12xx on the PSP/SDK from TI.
#
# This approach avoids the need to take the latest compat-wireless package 
# from public sources and patching this onto the SDK along with additional 
# patches that are currently being up-streamed. 
# These later patches are essential to address defects that have been found 
# during systems testing. This approach avoids the need to apply many 
# patches (100â€™s) which is unmanageable.
