# This is a TI specific version of the compat-wireless recipe using a
# compat-wireless package created from the TI Systems Tested mac80211 releases.
#
# This approach has been taken to simplify the packaging of a compat-wireless
# release for WL12xx on the PSP/SDK from TI.
#
# This approach avoids the need to take the latest compat-wireless package
# from public sources and patching this onto the SDK along with additional
# patches that are currently being up-streamed.
# These later patches are essential to address defects that have been found
# during systems testing. This approach avoids the need to apply many
# patches (100Ã¢s) which is unmanageable.
