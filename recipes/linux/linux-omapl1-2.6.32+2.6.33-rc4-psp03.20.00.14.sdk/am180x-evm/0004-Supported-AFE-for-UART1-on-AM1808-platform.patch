Subject: [PATCH 4/5] Supported AFE for UART1 on AM1808 platform

This patch contain following modifications:
1. Pinmuxing of UART1 RTS/CTS lines on UART1 only
if McASP is not selected

2. Since AR7 port type is better match for DaVinci UARTs,
patch forces DA8xx UART's to AR7 port type which enables
AFE capability on the ports.

3.The AFE was being enabled if hardware fifo size is >= bytes.
Modify it to check for 16 bytes to support AR7 ports which
has 16 byte hardware fifo.

4. Disables modem status interrupts (flow control interrupts)
on the davinci da850 based SoM. Because change in CTS line
status does not assert interrupt to ARM.

5. Modifies the RX fifo threshold from 1 to 8 bytes.
This increases throughput by 2Kbps at 4Mbps baudrate.
Modifying the AR7 ports Rx fifo threshold as a temporary
workaround until we find better solution.
